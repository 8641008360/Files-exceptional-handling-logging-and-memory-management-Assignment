        "    - Memory management in Python refers to the process of efficiently allocating and deallocating memory to ensure that the program runs effectively and doesn't waste resources. Python’s memory management system handles the allocation of memory for objects and their variables and manages the cleaning up of unused objects when they are no longer needed.\n",
